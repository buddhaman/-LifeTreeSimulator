# To Build:

   Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and put in your own API key. Install npm, ask claude how and then run:

    - `npm run dev`

The human mind simply cannot hold all the possible branches of life when every big decision creates new possibilities. With just a handful of choices, you are already facing thousands of potential futures and your brain alone cannot keep track of them all.

**LifeTree Simulator** reveals these pathways.  
Enter your current situation and our AI builds a navigable decision tree that shows every major choice and its outcomes. Click any node to explore what could follow. Our AI lays out all realistic paths forward, whether you want to see career shifts, moves, new relationships, or surprising opportunities.

**Make better decisions by seeing all your true options instead of just imagining them.**  
For the first time, you can view the entire landscape of your possible futures.
